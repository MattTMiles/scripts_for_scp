This is just information on how to tackle the plots - not to do with the code:

# -g png at the end of the plot to save a png
#-g f.png/png will create a png file called f.png
#-g \? will give you all the different plot types that are supported

#-Yd means dedisperse

#-DF filename.T -g filename.D.png/png will givethe shape of the profile 
#-Gd will give the greyscale version
